# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-17

### Added
- `pyproject.toml` project URLs: Repository, Documentation, Issues, and Changelog — so the PyPI page
  links to the GitHub repo and docs.
- README badges (PyPI version, supported Python versions, license).
- `CHANGELOG.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

### Fixed
- The `phase5` command summary now reports the `code_unescape` step (it ran before but was omitted from
  the printed report).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-17

### Added
- Initial release.
- `convert` — dual-pass MinerU pipeline: a `pipeline -m txt` base pass (byte-perfect code from the
  embedded text layer) merged with a hybrid/VLM pass (table grids, Mermaid diagrams), with code
  token-verification and a coverage gate that hard-stops on dropped pages.
- `phase5` — six-step post-processing chain (caption unbleed, language re-tag, dash normalize, Mermaid
  repair, code unescape, chapter split with YAML frontmatter).
- `qa` — reproducible page sampling and per-page review artifacts.
- `scan` — PDF directory triage (title/year guesses).
- `batch` — manifest-driven, resumable multi-book runs with optional SSH-remote GPU execution.
- Full documentation set under `docs/` (Diátaxis: tutorials, how-to, reference, explanation) plus an
  arc42/C4 architecture overview.
